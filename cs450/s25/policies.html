UMB Academic Honesty Policy</a>, as described in Appendix B of the
Student Code of Conduct document.</p><p>The Provost&rsquo;s office conveys the following:</p><p>"Education at UMass Boston is sustained by academic integrity. Academic
integrity requires that all members of the campus community are
honest, trustworthy, responsible, respectful, and fair in academic
work at the university. As part of being educated here, students
learn, exercise, increase, and uphold academic integrity.  Academic
integrity is essential within all classrooms, in the many spaces where
academic work is carried out by all members of the UMass Boston
community, and in our local and global communities where the value of
this education fulfills its role as a public good."</p><p>This means that all submitted work must be completely yours, i.e.,
written from scratch, in your own words or code.</p><p>In addition, the Provost&rsquo;s office wishes to convey the following message about AI:</p><p>"AI is prohibited: In this class, all work submitted by students must be generated by the students themselves, whether working individually or in groups. Students should not have another person or entity do the writing of any portion of an assignment; this includes hiring a person or a company to write assignments and using AI tools like ChatGPT. All work submitted must contain citations for any material that has been quoted or referenced. If students are unsure about whether or not a source is appropriate to use in the assignment, they should contact the instructor."</p><p>See the <a href="#%28part._collaboration%29" data-pltdoc="x">Collaboration Policy</a> and <a href="#%28part._distribution%29" data-pltdoc="x">Distribution of Course Materials</a> Policy for

you may notify the course staff at any time before the homework in

For example, we may present solutions in
lecture right after a due date, but this is not possible if some
students have not submitted. Having to rearrange a course because of a
late assignment is unfair to other students in the class.</p></li><li><p>It takes up resources. Having to deal with late homework
leaves less staff time for office hours, discussion boards, etc.</p></li><li><p>Finally, because homework is assigned continually, a late
submission will cause work to overlap with subsequent assignments,
making it difficult to catch up.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, unforeseen things will happen. Therefore, we&rsquo;ve adopted the
following rules:</p><p>Over the course of the semester, you can use <span style="font-weight: bold">up to three late
days</span>. These can be allocated however you want (all to one assignment,
one to each assignment, etc.).</p><p>We strongly prefer you not use more than one per assignment, because
it disrupts grading; nevertheless, if you do need to take more than a
day on an assignment, you can.</p><p>Don&#8217;t ask for permission; don&rsquo;t tell us your reason: any time you miss
the submission deadline, we will assume you are using a late day. Each
part of a day that you are late counts as a full day. However, if you
take more than one day, you must inform us (post a private message on
the forum) so we know to expect something from you.</p><p>No exceptions allowed unless you have a Dean&#8217;s Note
indicating family/health emergency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: The course has enough homeworks that missing one is
probably not going to affect your course grade too much (and the
lowest grade is dropped anyways). <span style="font-weight: bold">It is far worse to fall
behind</span>. Therefore, if you miss a deadline, you may be best off
catching up with the content (through class or talking to course
staff) and moving on.</p><h4 class="heading">8<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._regrade)"></a>Regrade Policy<span class="button-group"><a href="#(part._regrade)" class="heading-anchor" title="Link to here">ðŸ”—</a><span style="visibility: hidden"> </span></span></h4><p>A student with a question or complaint about the grading of a question
