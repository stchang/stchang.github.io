Please read it carefully.</p><h4>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._honesty)"></a>Academic Honesty</h4><p>Students are expected to adhere to the Student Code of Conduct,
including policies about academic integrity, delineated in the
University of Massachusetts Boston Graduate Studies Bulletin,
Undergraduate Catalog, and relevant program student handbook(s),
linked at
<a href="https://www.umb.edu/academics/academic_integrity">https://www.umb.edu/academics/academic_integrity</a>.</p><p>See also
<a href="https://www.umb.edu/media/umassboston/content-assets/learningdesign/pdf/FINALUMBCode9-5-18-Appendix_B_V2.pdf">the
UMB Academic Honesty Policy</a>, as described in Appendix B of the
Student Code of Conduct document.</p><p>Education at UMass Boston is sustained by academic integrity. Academic
integrity requires that all members of the campus community are
honest, trustworthy, responsible, respectful, and fair in academic
work at the university. As part of being educated here, students
learn, exercise, increase, and uphold academic integrity.  Academic
integrity is essential within all classrooms, in the many spaces where
academic work is carried out by all members of the UMass Boston
community, and in our local and global communities where the value of
this education fulfills its role as a public good.</p><p>This means that all submitted work must be completely yours, i.e.,
written from scratch, in your own words or code.</p><p>See the <a href="#%28part._collaboration%29" data-pltdoc="x">Collaboration Policy</a> and <a href="#%28part._distribution%29" data-pltdoc="x">Distribution of Course Materials</a> Policy for
additional information.</p><h5><a name="(part._.Violations)"></a>Violations</h5><p><div class="SIntrapara">Academic honesty violations will result in:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>(1st offense) loss of credit on the problem and a warning,</p></li><li><p>(2nd offense) zero for the assignment and reported to the department and school,</p></li><li><p>(3rd offense) failing grade for the course.</p></li></ul></div></p><p>Note that the department and the Dean of Students (DoS) Office may
also impose additional penalties on top of the above.</p><p>See
<a href="https://www.umb.edu/media/umassboston/content-assets/learningdesign/pdf/FINALUMBCode9-5-18-Appendix_B_V2.pdf">list
of Academic Honesty Violations</a> and <a href="#%28part._collaboration%29" data-pltdoc="x">Collaboration Policy</a> for more details.</p><h4>2<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._collaboration)"></a>Collaboration Policy</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">All submitted work be must your own, i.e., written from
    scratch, in your own words or code</span>.</p><p>Thus, using sites that do your homework for you, e.g.,
Chegg, Course Hero, Study, Bartleby, etc., are <span style="font-weight: bold">not allowed</span> (The department
monitors these sites for infractions.)</p><p>Also, using <span class="emph">ChatGPT</span> is <span style="font-weight: bold">not allowed</span>.</p><p><span class="emph">Discussing</span> homework with other students, however, <span style="font-weight: bold">is
allowed</span> and encouraged.</p><p><span class="emph">Consulting</span> other reference sources (except the above) to learn
course materials <span style="font-weight: bold">is also allowed</span>.</p><p>All discussion or external sources, however, must be disclosed. See
<a href="#%28part._readme%29" data-pltdoc="x">README</a>.</p><h5><a name="(part._readme)"></a>README</h5><p><div class="SIntrapara">Every submitted homework must include a <span class="stt">README</span> file with:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>the names of other students you worked with,</p></li><li><p>any books or websites you consulted (other than the course textbooks), and</p></li><li><p>how long you spent on the assignment (in hours).</p></li></ul></div></p><h5><a name="(part._.Collaboration_.Violations)"></a>Collaboration Violations</h5><p>Submitting work that is not your own is an academic
honesty violation.</p><p>Note that taking someone else&rsquo;s answer and doing any of the following
is still considered "not your own words":</p><ul><li><p>changing variable names or replacing words with synonyms,</p></li><li><p>changing a sentence&rsquo;s grammar,</p></li><li><p>rearranging order of sentences or paragraphs,</p></li><li><p>cutting words or sentences,</p></li><li><p>any other isomorphic obfuscations.</p></li></ul><p>In our experience, none of these are ever an issue for students who
submit their own work. But if you are unsure, ask a member of the
course staff.</p><h5><a name="(part._.Regret_.Policy)"></a>Regret Policy</h5><p>(Adapted from <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty">Harvard CS50&rsquo;s policy</a>)</p><p>The course staff understands that many academic honesty violations
occur in a moment of panic right before a deadline.</p><p>Thus we will allow the following "regret" policy:</p><p><span class="emph">If you commit an academic honesty violation that you later regret,
you may notify the course staff at any time before the homework in
question has been graded and returned.</span></p><p>In exchange for your honesty, you will receive zero points for the
problem in question and the matter will be considered closed. No
additional penalties will be imposed and no further action
will be taken (except in the cases where this policy is abused).</p><h4>3<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._distribution)"></a>Distribution of Course Materials</h4><p>Course materials may not be distributed without permission from the
instructor.</p><p>This means you may not post homework questions to mailing lists or websites
like Stack Overflow, Chegg, Course Hero, etc.</p><p>Infractions will be considered academic honesty violations.</p><h4>4<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._grading)"></a>Grading</h4><p>Grades will be computed at the end of the semester according to the following criteria:</p><p><span class="Larger"><span style="font-weight: bold">Grade Components</span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Grades will be computed from the following:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>Homework assignments: 80%</p><p>This component of the grade will be computed by totaling all earned points on assignments and dividing by the maximum possible homework points.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: The lowest homework grade (i.e., the one that improves your final grade the most) will be dropped before final grade calculation.</p></li><li><p>Class Participation: 20%</p><p>This part of the grade will be
based on participation in lecture discussions and chats, submission of in-class quizzes and other work, office hour
attendance, discussion board posts and responses, and the instructor&rsquo;s
assessment of a student&rsquo;s overall engagement in the course.</p></li></ul></div></p><p><span class="Larger"><span style="font-weight: bold">Letter Grades</span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">The final grade will be calculated approximately as follows:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>A range: 90-100</p></li><li><p>B range: 80-90</p></li><li><p>C range: 70-80</p></li><li><p>D range: 60-70</p></li><li><p>F: &lt; 60</p></li></ul></div></p><p>The course staff reserves the right to adjust these as needed at the
end of the semester, including further splitting the grades into
plus/minus brackets.</p><h4>5<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._homework)"></a>Homework Submission Policy</h4><p>Homework is submitted to <a href="logistics.html#%28part._gradescope%29" data-pltdoc="x">Gradescope</a>, under the appropriate
assignment label. The submission must be a single file, and each page
must be assigned to the correct problem.</p><p>Homework solutions may be resubmitted as many times as needed, up to the deadline.</p><p>In addition to your solution files, each homework submission must
include a <a href="#%28part._readme%29" data-pltdoc="x">README</a> file with the following information:</p><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Time spent</span> (in hours) on the assignment,</p></li><li><p>the names of <span style="font-weight: bold">other students you worked with</span>,</p></li><li><p>and any other <span style="font-weight: bold">books or websites you used</span>.</p></li></ul><p>See the <a href="#%28part._collaboration%29" data-pltdoc="x">Collaboration Policy</a> for more details.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: <span class="emph">Only</span> homework submitted to Gradescope will count
in this course. Do not email hw submissions to the course staff. It
will be ignored and will not count.</p><h4>6<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._late)"></a>Late Policy</h4><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Homework is due</span> (typically) Mondays at 12:00pm EST (noon).</p><p>In general, late homework is not accepted, for many reasons:</p><ul><li><p>It is disruptive to the course. For example, we may discuss
or present solutions in lecture right after a homework is due. Having
to rearrange a course because of a late assignment is unfair to other
students in the class.</p></li><li><p>It takes up staff resources. Having to deal with late homework
means less time for office hours, discussion boards, etc.</p></li><li><p>Finally, because homework is assigned continually, a late
submission will cause work to overlap with subsequent assignments,
making it difficult to catch up.</p></li></ul><p>Of course, unforeseen things will happen. Therefore, we&rsquo;ve adopted the
following rules:</p><p>Over the course of the semester, you can use <span style="font-weight: bold">up to three late
days</span>. These can be allocated however you want (all to one assignment,
one to each assignment, etc.).</p><p>We strongly prefer you not use more than one per assignment, because
it disrupts grading; nevertheless, if you do need to take more than a
day on an assignment, you can.</p><p>Don&#8217;t ask for permission; don&rsquo;t tell us your reason: any time you miss
the submission deadline, we will assume you are using a late day. Each
part of a day that you are late counts as a full day. However, if you
take more than one day, you must inform us (post a private message on
the forum) so we know to expect something from you.</p><p>No exceptions allowed unless you have a Dean&#8217;s Note
indicating family/health emergency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: The course has enough homeworks that missing one is
probably not going to affect your course grade too much (and the
lowest grade is dropped anyways). <span style="font-weight: bold">It is far worse to fall
behind</span>. Therefore, if you miss a deadline, you may be best off
catching up with the content (through class or talking to course
staff) and moving on.</p><h4>7<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._lecturepolicy)"></a>Lecture Policy</h4><p>Lectures meet in-person. See also <a href="info.html#%28part._lecture%29" data-pltdoc="x">Lecture</a>.</p><p>Lecture may be recorded, but let the course staff know if you are not
comfortable with this.</p><p>Attendance is not taken, though overall partipation, of which lecture
is a part, is a factor in final grades. See also <a href="#%28part._grading%29" data-pltdoc="x">Grading</a>.</p><p>Also, there will usually be a short quiz or other classwork that is
submitted at the end of lecture.</p><p>This work is open book but you may have a limited amount of
time to complete it.</p><h4>8<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._accommodations)"></a>Accommodations</h4><p>UMass Boston is committed to creating learning environments that are
